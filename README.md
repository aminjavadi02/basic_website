this is a basic website, made by laravel framework. <br>
i tried to make it as clean as possible.<br>
there are some pages, which use one layout and include some sections,<br>
contact page, has a form which takes the message and save it in DB.<br>
the messages page, shows all messages.<br>
ps1: validation errors are customized in request<br>
ps2: there's a messages file in inc folder, that shows error or success messages.<br>
