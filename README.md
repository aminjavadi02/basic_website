this is a basic website, made by laravel framework. <br>
i tried to make it as clean as possible.
there are some pages, which use one layout and include some sections,
contact page, has a form which takes the message and save it in DB.
the messages page, shows all messages.
ps1: validation errors are customized in request
ps2: there's a messages file in inc folder, that shows error or success messages.
